This section of documentation is an introduction to a whole range of rather arbitrarily collected sources for my documenting practice. I have realized that my memory fails me most of the time. This in turn leads to frustration and anger.

It goes without saying that these emotions cloud your judgement, drift you away from reaching a solution to your problem, and unnecessarily disturb your inner peace. That is why I resolved to outsource my leaky memory to recorded thoughts. I bet you know there are many ways to record your thoughts i.e. you can speak to a dictating machine, write an article, draw a picture, or create an infographic, to name a few. My focal point is on the written text, however, a convergence of several information media adds to the richness of communication. So, if I want to become a successful tech communicator, I'll have to step up my game and draw inspiration from other disciplines.      


What is more, focusing on learning syntax of a programming language by heart distracts you from learning general programming concepts. I believe that understanding is far more crucial than regurgitating boilerplate code. This notion applies to almost all aspects of our lives. You don't have to remember       

That is why I resolved to outsource my leaky memory to recorded thoughts.

For large documentation sets we recommend adding content under the headings in this section, though if some or all of them donâ€™t apply to your project feel free to remove them or add your own. You can see an example of a smaller Docsy documentation site in the [Docsy User Guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/), which lives in the [Docsy theme repo](https://github.com/google/docsy/tree/master/userguide) if you'd like to copy its docs section.

Other content such as marketing material, case studies, and community updates should live in the [About](/about/) and [Community](/community/) pages.

Find out how to use the Docsy theme in the [Docsy User Guide](https://docsy.dev/docs/). You can learn more about how to organize your documentation (and how we organized this site) in [Organizing Your Content](https://docsy.dev/docs/best-practices/organizing-content/).
